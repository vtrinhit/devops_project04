## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Project Tasks
- Run a docker container
- Upload container into a public registry (hub.docker.com)
- Run the deployed application in a Kubernetes cluster
- Integrate with CircleCI for continuous integration
## Requirements
 - Python 3.7
## START HERE

### Step 0
- Fork this repo and clone it to your local workstation (obviously)

### Step 1: Install dependencies
- 
- Set up the environment by running `make setup`. This will create a virtual environment in your home directory called `.devops`
- Install dependencies by running `make install`
- (Optionally) Lint application (requires hadolint)

### Step 2: Run Docker container
- Run the application on docker by calling `./run_docker.sh`

### Step 3: Upload to Docker Hub
- In the `./upload_docker.sh` file, edit the dockerpath (line 8) and change the docker username to a personalized one (or leave it as is, to use the public vtrinh111/devopsproject4:v1.0.0)
- To upload to docker hub, run `./upload_docker.sh`

### Step 4: Kubernetes deployment
- To deploy to kubernetes, run `./run_kubernetes.sh`
